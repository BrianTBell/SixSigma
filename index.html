            <section>
                <h2>What is Six Sigma?</h2>
                <p>Six Sigma is a data-driven methodology for process improvement and quality management, aiming to reduce defects and variability in business processes. Developed by Motorola in the 1980s, it uses statistical tools and techniques to identify and eliminate root causes of errors, targeting near-perfection (3.4 defects per million opportunities). It emphasizes DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) for problem-solving and relies on trained professionals (e.g., Green Belts, Black Belts) to implement projects. Widely used across industries, Six Sigma enhances efficiency, reduces costs, and improves customer satisfaction.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>DMAIC Methodology</h2>
                <p>Six Sigma is grounded in the DMAIC methodology. The name 'DMAIC' is an acronym for the five phases which comprise the methodology. I'll go through each briefly.</p>
                <h3>1. Define</h3>
                <p>Set project goals and boundaries in alignment with your organizations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Business Goals.</li>
                    <li>Customer Needs.</li>
                    <li>The process that requires improvement.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2. Measure</h3>
                <p>Pinpoint the location/ source of problems by building a factual understanding of the existing process conditions. Also, establish a baseline capability level.</p>
                <h3>3. Analyze</h3>
                <p>Develop theories of root causes based on information from the 'measure' phase. Confirm theories with data and identify root causes of the problem.</p>
                <h3>4. Improve</h3>
                <p>Develop, implement, and evaluate solutions targeted at the verified cause. The goal is to prove with data that your solution(s) solves the problem and leads to an improvement.</p>
                <h3>5. Control</h3>
                <p>Concentrate on ensuring the problem stays fixed & new methods can be further improved over time.</p>

                        <h4>Bill Smith:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Motorola introduced six sigma as a measure of quality in 1986.</li>
                            <li>Smith, with Mikel Harry, developed the initial four-step six sigma stages: measure, analyze, control to reduce defect levels.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Mikel Harry:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Continued work from Motorola with Richard Schroeder, and founded Six Sigma Academy in 1994.</li>
                            <li>He's the main architect of the six sigma movement.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Crosby:</h4>
                        <p>He came up with his 'four absolutes'</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The definition of quality is conformance to requirements</li>
                            <li>The system of quality is prevention</li>
                            <li>The performance standard is zero defects</li>
                            <li>The measurement of quality is the price of nonconformance</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>All in all, this goes to say: "Do it right the first time".</p>
                        <h4>Deming's 14 Points:</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of product and service. Innovate, allocate resources to long-term planning. Put resources into research and education.</li>
                            <li>Adopt a new philosophy. Do not tolerate commonly accepted levels of errors or defects.</li>
                            <li>Cease dependence on mass inspection to achieve quality. Inspection does not improve quality. Quality is build into a product and cannot be inspected into it.</li>
                            <li>End the practice of awarding business on the basis of price tag alone. Minimize total cost by working with a single supplier.</li>
                            <li>Improve constantly in ever process for planning, production, and service. Continually improve test methods and identify problems, from the very first planning stage right up to distribution to customers.</li>
                            <li>Institute training on the job. In Japan, managers start their careers with a long internship. They work in procurement, accounting, distribution, and sales.</li>
                            <li>Adopt and institute leadership. The job of management is not supervision, but leadership.</li>
                            <li>Drive out fear, No one can perform unless he or she feels secure.</li>
                            <li>Break down barriers between staff areas. Create teams of members coming from all areas and sectors of the business to prevent and solve problems.</li>
                            <li>Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the workforce.</li>
                            <li>Eliminate numerical quotas for the workforce and numerical goals for management.</li>
                            <li>Remove barriers that rob people of the pride of workmanship. Eliminate the annual rating or merit system.</li>
                            <li>Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement for everyone.</li>
                            <li>Put everyone in the company to work to accomplish the transformation.</li>

                    <li>Sponsors drive change, cultivate resources, and champion projects.</li>
                    <li>Based on quantifiable measures that can be traced back to how well the business serves its customers.</li>
                    <li>Metrics identified early and aligned with the aims of the business while incentivizing and maintaining accountability</li>
                    <li>Accompanied by training and team deployment practices.</li>
                    <li>Utilizes Green Belts, Black Belts and Master Black Belts to execute various measurement, analysis, improvement and control tools.</li>

                <p>In order for Six Sigma and Lean to co exists and serve the interests of the organization several critical factors must be realized.</p>
                <u1>
                    <li>The methodology must be embraced at all levels of the organization.</li>
                    <li>The organization must have a strong customer focus and welcome change.</li>
                    <li>Teamwork and training are essential to project success.</li>
                    <li>The organization must have strong systems, procedures, and infrastructure to facilitate effective communication and collaboration.</li>
                    <li>Subject matter experts must implement it. Further, they must analyze results and devise an effective means toward measuring and quantifying improvement.</li>

            <!--Acceptable Standard Deviation-->
            <section>
                <h2>Acceptable Standard Deviation</h2>
                <p>Six Sigma uses a Gaussian Curve to model process variation. The mean represents the process average, and Six Sigma aims for 99.99966% defect free output. This means defects only occur +-6 sigma from the mean. (3.4M defects per opportunity).</p>
                <p>A +-1.5 sigma is used to account for long term process variation. The Gaussian curve assumes a stable process centered at the mean. However, real world processes drift over time due to factors like equipment wear or operator variability.</p>
                <p>A 1.5 sigma shift adjusts the mean toward USL or LSL to reflect typical long-term drift. A process designed for +=6 sigma (short-term) shifts to +- 4.5 sigma (long-term), increasing defects if unadjusted.</p>
                <p>This touches on the purpose of the control phase of DMAIC, we don't want a 1.5 sigma shift in the long term. To put this in perspective, see # defects at each level...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>6 sigma = 3.4 PPM</li>
                    <li>5 sigma = 233 PPM</li>
                    <li>4 sigma = 6,210 PPM</li>

                <p>Lean began as the Toyota Production System in 1973. Lean is essentially the elimination of waste. This waste can be identified through the process speed and efficiency, and reduced through continuous improvement.</p>
                <p>The five principles of Lean include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Value</li>

                <h2>Value of Six Sigma to and Organization</h2>
                <p>Six Sigma is valuable to both product and service companies. In simple terms this is a method to improve customer satisfaction and market share.</p>
                <p>It benefits and provides insights for all stakes holders through a project scoping system called SIPOC (Supplier, Inputs, Processes, Outputs, and Customers).</p>
                <p>SIPOC is employed to ensure the scope of the project is well understood. Further its acts as a checks and balances system for customers and stakeholders, and provides a glimpse into the potential benefits of the Six Sigma project implementation.</p>
                <p>The benefits of six sigma can be seen at the organizational output level in terms of profit, growth, additional orders and employee betterment and advancement.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, the customer community and society as a whole will see the true value.</p>
                <p>Improved quality design and conformance creates a cascade o9f impacts on customer perceived quality. This usually leads to lower service costs, increased margin and market share, and higher profitabilioty.</p>

                <h2>The role of Individuals</h2>
                <p>Six Sigma relies on strong teams, which are comprised of strong individuals. A way to identify each teams members best role is the Belbin Process.</p>
                <p>A Belbin individual report identifies which combination of the nine Belbin team roles someone prefers and exhibits an aptitude toward.</p>
                <p>Effective communication is imperative for strong teams. The best means of communication is 1 on 1 as its the most active means of communication for participants. This means should be pursued over more passive means like E-mail, Memos, Calls, etc.</p>
                <p>Ideal baseline aspects of a good team member:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Team work is a top priority.</li>
                    <li>Uses knowledge to contribute as fully as possible.</li>
                    <li>Active listener and open to the ideas of others.</li>
                    <li>Assists the black belt with meeting management.</li>
                    <li>Completes necessary tasks by deadlines.</li>
                    <li>Communicates with all levels of the team and organization effectively.</li>
                    <li>Understands that their contributions are part of the greater whole.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Yellow and Green Belts</h2>
                <p>A basic overview...</p>
                <h3>Yellow Belts</h3>
                <p>A yellow belts is someone who has been trained in Six Sigma to have a fundamental understanding of its principles.</p>
                <p>They should be up to speed enough to converse with other belt levels, know basic terms, etc.
                <p>Yellow belts training is targeted towards supervisors, managers, directors, and sometimes executives. Although the levels of hands on involvement with six sigma tools is diminished, yellow belts can still play an essential role ion moving the project forward.</p>
                <h3>Green Belts</h3>
                <p>A step above yellow, training includes all comprehensive elements of six sigma with less emphasis on statistical aspects and advanced techniques.</p>
                <p>Green belt has nearly identical responsibilities to the black belt when it comes to projects, but they typically work on less complex projects.</p>
                <p>You wont typically find a six sigma dedicated green belt in an organization. Their time is usually split between six sigma related work and other projects.</p>
                <p>Black belts are the dedicated six sigma people.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>The Fabled Black Belt</h2>
                <p>Of the Six Sigma belts, the black belt is the most active and valuable. They are well-rounded in terms of project management, statistical analysis, financial analysis, meeting facilitation, prioritization, and much more.</p>
                <p>The typical Black Belt has led several projects, coached and mentored lower belts, and understands how to define a problem in order to quickly drive towards a solution.</p>
                <p>A black belt can be dedicated support, or a professional who continues in their management role while achieving black belt.</p>
                <h3>Exactly what do they do?</h3>
                <p>Before a project they would...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Review the charter with sponsor and form understanding of the importance and scope of the problem.</li>
                    <li>Clarifies roles and responsibilities of all members.</li>
                    <li>Reviews the charter with master black belt.</li>
                    <li>Together they devise a project plan for the team review and consensus.</li>
                    <li>Understand project history and gathers any historical data.</li>
                    <li>Set meeting logistics and agendas.</li>
                    <li>Work with master black belt to identify training needs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After the project the black belt would...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Complete project documentation and distribute to others in organization.</li>
                    <li>See that process owner receives all necessary documentation for monitoring the solution.</li>
                    <li>Identify, document, and communicate lessons learned.</li>
                    <li>As project ends, transition responsibility for implementing the solution to work area manager and staff.</li>

            <section>
                <h2>Master Black Belt</h2>
                <p>The Master Black Belt is the most seasoned, educated and well capable of all Six Sigma experts. They have managed dozens of black belt projects, and typically coordinate several Six Sigma projects at once.</p>
                <p>They typically work with high level operations directors and senior executives to help assess and plan business objectives. They typically advise on the needs or cost of poor quality of an operation, and consult on approaches to addressing the problems.</p>
                <p>The team roles of a master black belt are...</p>
                <ul>

            <section>
                <h2>Champion</h2>
                <p>Champions are the people, directors, executives, managers, etc, who are chartering funding or driving the project that black belts and green belts are conducting. It is just as important for them to understand the methodology, process and dynamics of Six Sigma, as it is for black belts.</p>
                <p>Champions have responsibilities like the ones previously listed for yellow belts. Typical responsibilities for the champion include...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strategic oversight.</li>
                    <li>Determining the strategic direction of the project.</li>

            <!--Role of Sponsors-->
            <section>
                <h2>Sponsors</h2>
                <p>Sponsors are somewhat like champions, but the scope of the involvement is much less interactive. Sponsors set direction for the project. They also play a key commutative role at the highest levels of the organization.</p>
                <p>The responsibilities of a sponsor include...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Defining and drafting the charter.</li>
                    <li>Selection of team members.</li>
                    <li>Providing resources.</li>
                    <li>Assistance in removing barriers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Sponsors also play a critical role at the end of the project. They are involved in the final review, they help the team celebrate their success, communicate the results to the highest levels of the organization, monitor the change, and implement changes not withing the team's authority to ensure project success. They also keep a watchful eye over barriers, and systems in anticipation for future projects.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Process Owners</h2>
                <p>Process Owners are unique individuals that can take on multiple roles in a team. They can be champions or individual contributors. Regardless of their role on the team, they are seen as the subject matter experts of a specific and highly critical process under investigation as part of the project. Process owners are not black belts, but should have a basic understanding of statistical tools.</p>
